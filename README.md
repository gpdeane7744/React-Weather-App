# React-Weather-App
A simple weather app designed using React.js

A simple application demonstrating my abilities in various languages and frameworks.
The app uses various techniques and api's to accomplish the task of bringing 
the weather to the screen.

To run, each compnonent will need to be stored in a separate folder within src called Components.

The weather is set to return the weather at my location.

Future updates of the project will include locations based on user input, a search function that will
dynamically present search results to be selected by the user, and separate components and more detailed
weather data for each day when selected.
